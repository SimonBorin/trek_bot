  The galaxy is divided into an 8 X 8 quadrant grid, and each quadrant
is further divided into an 8 x 8 sector grid.

  You will be assigned a starting point somewhere in the galaxy to begin
a tour of duty as commander of the starship Enterprise. Your mission:
to seek out and destroy the fleet of Klingon warships which are menacing
the United Federation of Planets.

  Symbology on your sensor screen is as follows:
    <*> = Your starship's position
    +K+ = Klingon battlecruiser
    >!< = Federation starbase (Refuel/Repair/Re-Arm here)
     *  = Star

  A condensed 'Status Report' will also be presented

  You have the following commands available to you as Captain of the Starship
Enterprise:

/helm or /1 = Warp Engine Control --

  Course is in a circular numerical vector            7  8  9
  arrangement as shown. Integer                        . . .
  values may be used.                                   ...
                                                    4 ---*--- 6
                                                        ...
                                                       . . .
                                                      1  2  3

  One warp factor is the size of one quadrant.        COURSE
  Therefore, to get from quadrant 6x,5y to 5x,5y
  you would use course 4, warp factor 1.




/lsr or /2 = Long Range Sensor Scan

  Shows conditions in space for one quadrant on each side of the Enterprise
  (which is in the middle of the scan). The scan is coded in the form \###\
  where the units digit is the number of stars, the tens digit is the number
  of starbases, and the hundreds digit is the number of Klingons.

  Example - 207 = 2 Klingons, No Starbases, & 7 stars.

/phasers or /3 = Phaser Control.

  Allows you to destroy the Klingon Battle Cruisers by zapping them with
  suitably large units of energy to deplete their shield power. (Remember,
  Klingons have phasers, too!)

/torpedoes or /4 = Photon Torpedo Control

  Torpedo course is the same  as used in helm control. If you hit
  the Klingon vessel, he is destroyed and cannot fire back at you. If you
  miss, you are subject to the phaser fire of all other Klingons in the
  quadrant.

/shields or /5 = Shield Control

  Defines the number of energy units to be assigned to the shields. Energy
  is taken from total ship's energy. Note that the status display total
  energy includes shield energy.

/resign ot /6 = Restart

  Start a new game session
  Init new galaxy parameters

/help ot /0 = Shows Commands

  Print out all commands

/info = shows bot`s info

/manual = shows this manual
